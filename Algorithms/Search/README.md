Brief information about the search
============

- Line search: 

  This is a method of searching for an item in a list. It checks each item of the list sequentially until a 
  match is found or the entire list is searched. Linear search is performed in the worst case in linear time and 
  makes no more than n comparisons, where n is the length of the list.
  
- Binary search: 

  Binary search works on a sorted array. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array 
  with the target value. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value 
  is less than an element, the search continues in the lower half of the array.

- Block seacrh: 

  If the records are ordered by key, then each record does not need to be read when scanning the file. A computer could, for example, 
  view every hundredth record in the sequence of ascending keys. When a record with a key greater than the desired value is found, 
  the last 99 records that were skipped are viewed. This method is called block search.
