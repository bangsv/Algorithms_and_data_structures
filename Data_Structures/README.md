Data structures
======
- Data structures are containers that store data in a specific format. This specific format gives the data structure certain qualities that distinguish it from other structures and make it suitable (or, conversely, unsuitable) for certain use cases.
    - Stack is a data structure consisting of an ordered set of elements, in which new elements are added and existing ones are removed from one end, 
    called the top of the stack. Moreover, the element that was placed there last is removed first from the stack, that is, 
    the strategy "last in — first out" (last-in, first-out — LIFO) is implemented in the stack.
    - A table is a structured data set consisting of rows and columns. Tables allow you to quickly and easily view values showing some relationship between different types of data, for example, a person and his age, or a schedule in a swimming pool.
